      <h4>Education tailored to your child</h4>
      <p>Julene founded Learning Hearts Therapy almost 20 years ago
        out of her home 'Montessori'. Then, an 
        endearing little boy with ASD came to her for help, igniting a special 
        calling in teaching - and the rest is history.</p>
      <p>The programme at Learning Hearts Therapy is the by-product of her genuine 
        passion and in-depth experience in the areas of foundational reading and 
        numeracy development.</p>

            <h4 class="">Years of Training and Experience</h4>
            <p>Julene finds the greatest challenge and satisfaction in helping children with learning difficulties. She has worked with children diagnosed with mild ASD, ADHD, Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, and SLI, as well as those from broken, 
              troubled and disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
              <p>Julene believes firmly in the transfer of knowledge to all people who work with and nurture children, hence the many workshops she has 
                conducted for both parents and teachers, to empower them to help children acquire critical reading and numeracy strategies.</p>
              <p>
                For over 10 years, Julene was the in-house reading specialist consultant at CHIJ Kellock where she taught P1 and P2 students and trained the 
                teachers. The then Little Reading Hearts reading strategies programme was also brought to several other neighbourhood schools across the island. 
                Prior to these engagements, Julene was a part-time reading therapist with an established dyslexia remediation centre in Camden Medical Centre.

          <p>Here at Learning Hearts Therapy, we do not utilize any prepackaged/can reading programme. Instead, our approach is to teach the way children learn, rather than expect them to learn the way we teach.</p>
          <p>The programme features and is aligned with what internationally recognised institutions and organisations (National Reading Panel, US; Department for Education, UK; National Council for Teachers of Mathematics) deem to be the 'best practices' in the teaching of foundational reading and numeracy skills for children. This includes the use of explicit, systematic, cumulative curricula and a multi-sensory approach, in addition to the integration of all sub-areas of learning (eg. reading, writing, spelling; mathematics in real life situations). Apart from these,
            the programme boasts of some special features:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Personalised teaching, in a one-to-one ratio, to each child's individual challenges and needs, and takes into consideration the whole child</li>
            <li>Integrates several subject areas (eg. English and Literature/Geography) and bridges to standardised exams (PSLE, 'N/O' levels, iGCSEs</li>
            <li>Developed by an educational therapist trained in the field of Specific Learning Difficulties, with extensive experience in the field, both as teacher and teacher trainer</li>
            <li>Takes into account the unique challenges posed by Singaporean culture, language development and school curriculum</li>
            <li>Focuses on building strategies and fundamental concepts, for children from N2 to Sec 4, particularly those with mild to moderate learning difficulties</li>
            <li>Extends to secondary levels for Math, Science, English, Literature, and Geography, supported by our small but dedicated, hand-picked team</li>
          </ul>
