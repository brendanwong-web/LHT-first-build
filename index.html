              <p>Julene founded Learning Hearts Therapy almost 20 years ago, teaching a 
                handful of young children in her home 'Montessori' balcony. Then, an 
                endearing little boy with ASD came to her for help, igniting a special 
                calling in teaching... and the rest is history.</p>
              <p>The programme at Learning Hearts Therapy is the by-product of her genuine 
                passion for, and in-depth experience in the area of foundational reading & 
                numeracy development.</p>

                  <p>Julene finds the greatest challenges and satisfaction in helping children with learning difficulties, either due to their background 
                  or pre-existing disabilities. She has worked with children with mild ASD, ADHD, Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, SLI; as well as those from broken, 
                  troubled and disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
                  <p>Julene has a firm belief in the transfer of knowledge to all people who work with and nurture children; hence the many workshops she has 
                    conducted for both teachers and parents, to empower them to help children acquire critical reading and numeracy strategies.</p>
                  <p>
                    Julene was, for over 10 years, the in-house reading specialist consultant at CHIJ Kellock where she taught P1 and P2 students and trained the 
                    teachers. The then Little Reading Hearts reading strategies programme was also brought to several other neighbourhood schools across the island.
                  </p>  
                  <p>Prior to these engagements, Julene was a part-time reading therapist with an established dyslexia remediation centre in Camden Medical Centre.</p>

                  <p>Here at Learning Hearts Therapy, we do not utilize any prepackaged/can reading programme. Instead, our approach is to teach the way children learn, rather than expect them to learn the way we teach.</p>
                  <p>The programme features and is aligned with what internationally recognised institutions and organisations (National Reading Panel, US; Department for Education, UK; National Council for Teachers of Mathematics) deem to be the 'best practices' in the teaching of foundational reading and numeracy skills for children. This includes the use of explicit, systematic, cumulative curricula and a multi-sensory approach, in addition to the integration of all sub-areas of learning (eg. reading, writing, spelling; mathematics in real life situations). Apart from these,
                    the programme boasts of some special features:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Personalised teaching, in a one-to-one ratio, to each child's individual challenges and needs, and takes into consideration the whole child</li>
                    <li>Integrates several subject areas (eg. English and Literature/Geography) and bridges to standardised exams (PSLE, 'N/O' levels, iGCSEs</li>
                    <li>Developed by an educational therapist trained in the field of Specific Learning Difficulties, with extensive experience in the field, both as teacher and teacher trainer</li>
                    <li>Takes into account the unique challenges posed by Singaporean culture, language development and school curriculum</li>
                    <li>Focuses on building strategies and fundamental concepts, for children from N2 to Sec 4, particularly those with mild to moderate learning difficulties</li>
                    <li>Extends to secondary levels for Math, Science, English, Literature, and Geography, supported by our small but dedicated, hand-picked team</li>

                in exams.</p>
              <p>We feel it is important to view your child's learning as a partnership 
                between parents and teacher. We keep parents abreast of progress through

                <p>Ellen started as an in-house legal counsel in Jakarta, Indonesia before moving to Singapore where she practised mainly as a compliance officer in various banks, stock broking firms and fund management companies. </p>
                <p>Ellen met Julene at a workshop empowering parents to teach children reading and wanted to learn more about teaching her own child.  Julene invited Ellen to observe her teaching at CHIJ Kellock and shortly after that, Ellen decided to give up her career and enter education.</p>
                <p>Ellen spent the first year observing julene, shadowing her teaching.  In 2010 when the reading hearts programme was taken up by Shu Qun primary for all P1 and P2 pupils, Ellen joined the team to deliver it. Following that, Ellen took a sabbatical to have and take care of her second child and rejoined Julene in 2014 just before they started teaching the programme at Queenstown primary school. In 2015, they both decided to concentrate their energies on the children struggling with reading disabilities, stopping the school-based programme to focus entirely on educational therapy work. Ellen has been teaching with Julene ever since.</p>

                  The name Learning Hearts is apt as the people who make this learning centre 
                  happen, operate from their hearts. 
                  
                  I first met Julene, who my son affectionately calls Aunty Ju, in early 2018. 
                  She was recommended by my son's educational psychologist. I am grateful that 
                  she put me in contact with Julene. From the first phone call, I knew that she had my child's
                  interest at heart...
                  
                </p>
                <div id="demo1" class="collapse">
                  <p>We started with Julene for learning therapy at first. My son was identified with profound
                  dyslexia and he has a lot of anxiety, especially separation anxiety. My son then moved on to 
                  be guided by Ellen, and together they put my son at ease. So much so that he looks forward 
                  to learning therapy weekly!
                  
                  Fast forward, and my son has improved by leaps and bounds. We will always be in touch
                  with Julene and Ellen, even after Dean graduates from Learning Hearts,
                  as Julene and Ellen are now our confidants.

                  Our son came under the tutelage of Julene when he was 13, who was recommended by both our educational psychologist and occupational therapist. Julene imparted effective study skills and strategies that helped him become an effective and enthusiastic student.

                  <p>As his academic results improved, his self confidence also increased. This now translates into a recurring systematic approach to learning new skills and subjects, long after he had left Learning Hearts Therapy. Julene is more than an educational therapist; she is a friend to students and parents alike. She is empathetic, kind, approachable, fun-loving and yet remains driven to ensure her students grow up to be independent and effective learners, and more importantly, to find joy in life Long learning! Thank you Julene!</p>

                  Two of our children had learning disabilities and could not keep 
                  pace with their peers in school. They needed specialized help. We did not 
                  know how to help them, but Julene did. In her care, our daughter regained her 
                  confidence her reading, spelling and mathematics.

              <p>Our usual procedure is for the parent(s) to first book a consultation with the principal therapist. Following that, if we determine we can be of help, a quick assessment is to be conducted to help us develop a learning profile and therapy plan that is customised to the child. 
              </p>
